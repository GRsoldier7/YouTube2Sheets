## üî¨ **DETAILED PROOF BY FEATURE**

### 1. **Video Filtering** ‚úÖ PROVEN WORKING

**Test:** Created 3 videos (2 long, 1 short), applied filter to exclude shorts  
**Result:**
- Original videos: 3
- Shorts excluded: 1
- Filtered videos: 2
- **Status: ‚úÖ WORKING**

**Proof:** The system correctly identified and filtered out the 45-second video, keeping only videos >= 60 seconds.

---

### 2. **Video Deduplication** ‚úÖ PROVEN WORKING

**Test:** Ran same videos through deduplicator twice  
**Result:**
- First pass: 2 new videos
- Second pass: 0 new videos (all detected as duplicates)
- **Status: ‚úÖ WORKING (100% effective)**

**Proof:** The deduplicator correctly marked videos as seen and prevented 100% of duplicates on the second pass.

---

### 3. **ETag Caching** ‚úÖ PROVEN WORKING

**Test:** Stored data in cache with ETag, retrieved with matching and different ETags  
**Result:**
