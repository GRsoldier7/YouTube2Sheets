## Issues Resolved

### 1. Unicode Encoding Errors (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Emoji characters in print statements causing `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows
**Root Cause:** Windows console using cp1252 encoding couldn't display Unicode emojis
**Solution:** 
- Created `fix_unicode_emojis.py` script
- Replaced all emoji characters with text equivalents
- Fixed in `src/services/youtube_service.py`, `src/services/automator.py`, `src/services/sheets_service.py`
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED

### 2. Max Results Validation Error (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** GUI was passing `max_results=1000` causing `ValidationError: Max results must be between 1 and 50`
**Root Cause:** Backup GUI files still had `max_videos=1000` setting
**Solution:**
- Fixed `src/gui/main_app.py` (already had `max_videos=50`)
- Fixed `src/gui/exact_image_layout.py` (line 760)
- Fixed `src/gui/main_app_backup.py` (line 1249)
- Cleared Python cache to ensure fresh code loading
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED

### 3. Destination Model Error (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** `Destination.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'spreadsheet_url'`
**Root Cause:** Test was using `spreadsheet_url` but model expects `spreadsheet_id`
**Solution:**
- Updated test to extract `spreadsheet_id` from URL using regex
- Fixed `test_end_to_end_smoke.py` to use correct model structure
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED

### 4. Python Cache Issues (HIGH)
**Problem:** Code changes not taking effect due to cached bytecode
**Root Cause:** `__pycache__` directories containing old compiled code
**Solution:**
- Cleared all Python cache directories
- Removed all `.pyc` files
- Verified fresh imports in tests
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED
