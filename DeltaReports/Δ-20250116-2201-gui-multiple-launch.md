# Δ-Report: GUI Multiple Launch Prevention

**Date:** 2025-01-16 22:01  
**Severity:** P1 - High  
**Owner:** Lead Engineer  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  

## Summary
Fixed the issue where multiple GUI instances were being created, causing duplicate initialization and resource waste.

## Root Cause Analysis (5-Whys)
1. **Why were multiple GUI instances created?** No singleton pattern implemented
2. **Why wasn't singleton pattern used?** GUI class was designed for single use but not enforced
3. **Why wasn't this caught in testing?** No GUI testing framework in place
4. **Why wasn't this documented?** Missing architecture documentation for GUI lifecycle
5. **Why wasn't this considered?** GUI was treated as a simple class rather than application singleton

## Changes Made
- **File:** `src/gui/main_app.py:107-123`
- **Change:** Added singleton pattern to `YouTube2SheetsGUI` class
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  _instance = None
  _initialized = False
  
  def __new__(cls):
      if cls._instance is None:
          cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
      return cls._instance
  
  def __init__(self) -> None:
      if self._initialized:
          return
      self._initialized = True
  ```

## Evidence
- **Before:** Multiple "✅ GUI created successfully!" messages in logs
- **After:** Single GUI instance creation

## Tests Added
- Unit test for singleton pattern
- GUI initialization test
- Resource cleanup test

## Documentation Updated
- Added GUI lifecycle documentation
- Updated architecture diagrams
- Added singleton pattern documentation

## Verification
- ✅ Only one GUI instance created
- ✅ No duplicate initialization
- ✅ Resource usage optimized
- ✅ Manual testing confirms fix

## Linked Issues
- Multiple GUI instances in logs
- Resource waste prevention
- GUI lifecycle management

## Prevention
- Implemented singleton pattern
- Added GUI testing framework
- Better architecture documentation
