# Δ-Report: Async Task Leak Prevention

**Date:** 2025-01-16 22:02  
**Severity:** P1 - High  
**Owner:** Lead Engineer  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  

## Summary
Fixed async task leak in automator where background tasks were created but not properly tracked or cleaned up.

## Root Cause Analysis (5-Whys)
1. **Why were async tasks leaking?** Background tasks created but not tracked
2. **Why weren't they tracked?** No mechanism to store and manage background tasks
3. **Why wasn't cleanup implemented?** Cleanup only handled thread pool, not async tasks
4. **Why wasn't this caught in testing?** No async task testing coverage
5. **Why wasn't this documented?** Missing documentation for async task lifecycle

## Changes Made
- **File:** `src/services/automator.py:51-52`
- **Change:** Added background task tracking
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  # Background task tracking for proper cleanup
  self.background_tasks = set()
  ```

- **File:** `src/services/automator.py:417-420`
- **Change:** Track background tasks properly
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  # Create background task and track for cleanup
  task = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.gather(*prefetch_tasks, return_exceptions=True))
  self.background_tasks.add(task)
  task.add_done_callback(self.background_tasks.discard)
  ```

- **File:** `src/services/automator.py:102-111`
- **Change:** Added background task cleanup
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  # Cancel all background tasks
  try:
      if hasattr(self, 'background_tasks') and self.background_tasks:
          print("[CLEANUP] Cancelling background tasks...")
          for task in self.background_tasks:
              if not task.done():
                  task.cancel()
          print(f"[CLEANUP] Cancelled {len(self.background_tasks)} background tasks")
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"[CLEANUP] Error cancelling background tasks: {e}")
  ```

## Evidence
- **Before:** Background tasks created but not cleaned up
- **After:** All background tasks properly tracked and cancelled

## Tests Added
- Unit test for background task tracking
- Async task cleanup test
- Resource leak detection test

## Documentation Updated
- Added async task lifecycle documentation
- Updated cleanup process documentation
- Added resource management guide

## Verification
- ✅ Background tasks tracked properly
- ✅ Cleanup cancels all tasks
- ✅ No resource leaks
- ✅ Manual testing confirms fix

## Linked Issues
- Async task leak in line 415
- Resource cleanup improvements
- Background task management

## Prevention
- Implemented proper task tracking
- Added comprehensive cleanup
- Better async task documentation
