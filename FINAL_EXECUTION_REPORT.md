## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Cache Save Error** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** `'ResponseCache' object has no attribute 'save_to_disk'`
- **Fix:** Updated method call from `save_to_disk()` to `_save_to_disk()`
- **Evidence:** Cache now saves successfully during cleanup
- **Delta Report:** `Δ-20250116-2200-cache-save-fix.md`

### 2. **GUI Multiple Launch** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Multiple GUI instances being created
- **Fix:** Implemented singleton pattern in `YouTube2SheetsGUI`
- **Evidence:** Only one GUI instance created per application
- **Delta Report:** `Δ-20250116-2201-gui-multiple-launch.md`

### 3. **Async Task Leak** - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Background tasks created but not tracked/cleaned up
- **Fix:** Added background task tracking and proper cleanup
- **Evidence:** All background tasks properly cancelled during cleanup
- **Delta Report:** `Δ-20250116-2202-async-task-cleanup.md`
