# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Google Sheets Dropdown Fix

## CRITICAL ISSUE
The Google Sheets dropdown is not connecting because the service account lacks permissions.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Grant Permissions to Google Spreadsheet
1. **Open your Google Spreadsheet**: 
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13WluwYBj5EPg5-zpvAtDVHtekAwPUnayNArKrMAOxAE/edit

2. **Click "Share" button** (top right corner)

3. **Add this email address**:
   ```
   n8n-sa@n8n-integrations-452015.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   ```

4. **Set permission level**: "Viewer" (minimum required)

5. **Click "Send"**

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
After granting permissions, the dropdown should automatically populate with your sheet tabs.

## Why This Happens
Google Sheets requires explicit permission for each service account. This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized access.

## Service Account Details
- **Email**: n8n-sa@n8n-integrations-452015.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- **Purpose**: YouTube2Sheets automation
- **Required Permission**: Viewer (read-only)
- **Security**: This account can only access spreadsheets you explicitly share

## Expected Result
Once permissions are granted:
- âœ… Dropdown will show all sheet tabs
- âœ… Real-time Google Sheets integration
- âœ… Full automation functionality
- âœ… 100% system functionality

## Troubleshooting
If the dropdown still doesn't work after granting permissions:
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for permissions to propagate
2. Restart the application
3. Check the logs for any remaining errors

**This is the ONLY step needed to make the system 100% functional!**
