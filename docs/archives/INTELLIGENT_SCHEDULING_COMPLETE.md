# üß† INTELLIGENT SCHEDULING ADD-ON - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Architect:** Savant Architect & Lead Engineer (PolyChronos Œ© v5.0)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE & PROPERLY INTEGRATED  
**Purpose:** Intelligent scheduler add-on providing missed job detection, recovery, and monitoring.

---

## üöÄ OVERVIEW

- ‚úÖ Missed job detection and automatic recovery
- ‚úÖ Startup recovery mechanism
- ‚úÖ Flexible scheduling engine enhancements
- ‚úÖ Health monitoring and alerting
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation and resilience

---

## üîß FEATURES

### Detect Missed Jobs
- Identify overdue jobs based on configurable thresholds
- Capture expected run times and missed durations
- Recommend recovery strategies (immediate execution, deferred, skip)

### Startup Recovery
- Run once at launch to clear backlog after downtime
- Summaries of recovered vs failed jobs
- Optional dry-run mode to inspect without execution

### Continuous Monitoring
- Background loop checks for new overdue jobs
- Configurable interval and thresholds
- OS signal handlers for graceful shutdown

### Health Status Reporting
- System uptime, CPU/memory usage snapshots
- Job statistics (total, active, overdue, failed)
- Last check timestamp for observability

### Configuration Management
- Enable/disable features via CLI flags or config file
- Update thresholds without restarting core app

---

## üìã CLI COMMANDS

```
python intelligent_scheduler_script.py --startup-recovery
python intelligent_scheduler_script.py --check-missed
python intelligent_scheduler_script.py --health-status
python intelligent_scheduler_script.py --continuous
python intelligent_scheduler_script.py --execute
python intelligent_scheduler_script.py --configure key=value
```

### Examples
- `--startup-recovery`: catch up after downtime
- `--continuous`: run monitoring loop (Ctrl+C to stop)
- `--configure check_interval_minutes=30`

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY FEATURES
- Guarded behind environment flag (`ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_SCHEDULER`)
- Non-invasive: core scheduler still functional alone
- Extensive logging (status, errors, recommendations)
- Configurable backoff to avoid repeated failures

---

## üß™ TESTING
- Unit tests covering detection logic and configuration
- Manual CLI smoke tests for each command path
- Logging verified for both success and failure scenarios

---

## üìå INTEGRATION NOTES
- Optional component; enabled via CLI or env var
- Hooked into scheduler runner to emit missed-job warnings
- Extensible for future ML-driven optimizations
